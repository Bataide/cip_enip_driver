		<meta name="CIP ENIP DRIVER" content="Driver/library to communicate with Rockwell PLCs (ControlLogix family) using CIP protocol over Ethernet/IP. This library was developed in .NET Core 2.0, supporting cross-platform (Linux/Windows). The bigger advantage of this Driver is the possibility to write data (send a message) to a device or PC in both directions. We don't need to making polling checking for new information (unlike implicit messages work - via UDP protocol, degradating the network). The information will be send to us just when it's ready, finally available." />
